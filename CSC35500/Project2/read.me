My code seems to work well with no bugs when I ran it.
1) Nothing as there is not enough passenfers
2) There is also a deadlock as all passengers dont go on oneplane
3) In my program it does no run as no plane fills up to be ready for take off
4) This works, as there are enough passengers to fill up my planes
5) The min is 96, as this will gaurantee all planes get 12 passengers
