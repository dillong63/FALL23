Develped in Linux 
There are no special instructions for compiling. However, my program at this moment
can execute multiple pipes but there after it has a residual that has to be executed again. That is the only 
problem I have detected with some other bugs here or there.

I basically just approached this problem one command at a time, it was very frustrating at times.
